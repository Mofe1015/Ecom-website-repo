## Check out my latest project >> [ ECOM WEB-APP](https://github.com/Mofe1015/Ecom-website-repo)

This ia a Ecommerce website made with DJANGO, PYTHON, JAVASCRIPT, CSS, HTML. The goal is to implement the Django framework for large scale Ecom Web applications, By creating a personal database for products, completion and placement of orders

So far, Cart Functionality , Order Placement and a couple database features (using Django Models ) have been fully implemented. I also hope to integrate Api usage and payment verification with PayPal etc.
